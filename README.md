DigilibLT Corpus
=================

\[Quote from the original website\]: "The Digital Library of Late-Antique Latin Texts—DigilibLT—publishes secular prose texts written in Latin in late antiquity (from the second to the seventh century AD). The texts are annotated according to the XML-TEI standards and are offered free of charge to the public for reading and research."

## About this version
This version of the DigilibLT corpus makes use of the [Capitains](https://capitains.org) definition of passages and structures, in order to make passages machine-actionable
